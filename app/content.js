    analyser: `According to Merrill and Reid, the analyser social style combines low 
    levels of assertiveness and responsiveness. Analysers take precise and systematic 
    approaches to their work and usually gather and analyse information before they act. 
    Analysers tend to be industrious, well-organised and prefer objectivity and order, 
    according to Professor Alan Darling of Pittsburgh University, analysers are most likely 
    to be found working in engineering, accounting and law.`,

    driver: `Drivers are high in assertiveness and low in responsiveness. 
    Their main priority is to achieve positive results with the task at hand. 
    When under pressure, a driver asserts themselves strongly and tries 
    to control the pace and direction of a project or task. Obsessed with 
    high performance and constantly working at a fast pace, drivers are 
    "easily irritated by inefficiency" and indecision. Consequently, drivers
     are most likely to be found working in high-pressure environments, such as sales.`,

    expressive: `Expressive people are high in both assertiveness and responsiveness. 
    "Friendly and easy-going," expressive people work at a fast pace and try 
    to "create an environment that encourages flexibility" They like to try 
    new and different activities and "embody an 'in the here and now' attitude 
    towards life‚Äù. They "tend to have happy spirits and can endure hardships" 
    better than other personality styles. Consequently, they tend to be more 
    attracted to positions in advertising, entertainment and the arts.`,

    amiable: `People who are low in assertiveness and high in responsiveness are 
    characterised as having an amiable social style. According to the 
    Merrill and Reid model, amiable people "work well with others" and 
    "prefer to maintain relationships and avoid confrontation." Working 
    at a "slow and easy pace," amiable people work better when given a 
    specific task to do, under supervision. According to Alan Darling, 
    professor at Pittsburgh University, they are most likely to be found 
    in nursing, counselling and classroom teaching.`,
